On behalf of the Democratic Alliance (DA) I would like to wish the South African Muslim community Eid Mubarak. The month of Ramadaan has beenÂ a time for reflection, prayer, giving and sacrifice, and most importantly a recommitment to the universal values of humanity and humility. May you have a blessed day spent with family and friends at the end of this auspicious month. I wish all Muslims a happy and peaceful day.

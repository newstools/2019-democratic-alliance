Find attached soundbites in English and Zulu from DA Shadow Minister of Sports, Arts & Culture, Tsepo Mhlongo MP. The Democratic Alliance joins South Africans in wishing our national women’s football team, Banyana Banyana, the best of luck as they take on Spain tomorrow in their first game to mark their debut in the FIFA Women’s World Cup. Banyana Banyana’s qualification for the World Cup is a historic moment for women’s sports in South Africa. We hope that their achievement in qualifying for the world cup will add momentum to the struggles that women have fought over the years to get equal recognition for their sporting achievements. We believe that this talented side has what it takes to compete with the best in the world and make South Africa proud. Coach Desiree Ellis has instilled a sense of belief and purpose in the side which has made them competitive and a joy to watch. Banyana Banyana’s participation in the world cup will serve to inspire girls and young women in other sporting codes to aspire to play on the world stage. Sithi halala Mbokodo, halala Makhosikazi. You have our full and unwavering support!

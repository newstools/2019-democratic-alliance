The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Ministers of State Security, Ayanda Dlodlo, and International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), Naledi Pandor, to urgently answer on the whereabouts of Former President Jacob Zuma’s former ally and top spy, Thulani Dlomo Given the myriad of allegations against him and his purported role in State Capture – the public requires clarity on Dlomo’s whereabouts and whether he is currently in the employ of the state. It cannot be that an individual with such close ties to State Capture and the manipulation of the state machinery could potentially be living off the public’s money, whilst evading accountability. Reports today indicate that Dlomo has been missing in action for several months after he was recalled by President Cyril Ramaphosa from his ambassadorship in Japan in January 2019. Dlomo previously worked for the Department of Social Development in KwaZulu-Natal as their Head of Security in 2012. He resigned abruptly before a forensic audit found that he had received kickbacks of R1 million for tenders worth R45 million. By the time the audit was made public, he had already moved on to work at the State Security Agency (SSA). The SSA and DIRCO must break their silence on this matter, as Dlomo has a case to answer for at the Zondo Commission and before the Courts. It is for this reason that the DA has asked the Ministers: There are many questions which have been left unanswered on this matter. The DA will continue to seek clarity, to ensure that not a single cent of the people’s money is spent on the employment of Thulani Dlomo.

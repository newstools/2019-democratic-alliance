Today the DA Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry, Dean Macpherson MP, laid criminal charges against companies and officials involved in fake Gupta-linked BEE certificates. He was joined by the DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, Natasha Mazzone MP, and the DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, Mat Cuthbert MP.  Today the Democratic Alliance (DA) laid criminal charges against various companies and individuals who have been implicated in the awarding of fake BEE certificates to Gupta-linked companies. These charges follows the explosive findings by the BBBEE Commission that Gupta aligned companies used fraudulent BEE certificates to secure contracts and payments from Eskom. The 18-month in-depth investigation by the Commission is another window into the murky, abusive and corrupt world of State Capture by Gupta companies, pliable Eskom officials, high-ranking politicians and the side-line enablers in the corporate sector to give a veneer of legitimacy to their smoke and mirror dealings. The DA laid criminal charges against the following: The DA will also lay complaints with the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) and South African Institute for Chartered Accountants. The BBBEE Commission is yet another nail in the coffin of the Gupta empire and a piece of the puzzle in State Capture. It is also a reminder of how the policy of BEE has been abused by the elite and politically connected to lock out competition, inflate costs and entrench patronage networks. This is why DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, has called for the current model of BEE to be scrapped and for it to be replaced by a new model of genuine redress and inclusive growth that creates a shared future that all South Africans can be proud of. The onus now rests with the SAPS to investigate these criminal complaints to the fullest extent of the law and to ensure that these monies are recouped and those implicated have their day in court.

The Democratic Alliance Student Organisation (DASO) won three Student Representative Council (SRC) seats in the recent elections at the Taletso TVET College. Taletso TVET College is a predominantly South African Student Congress (SASCO) and Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command (EFFSC) campus. DASO contested the SRC elections on 30 July 2019 and won the treasurer position. On 4 September 2019, we contested two vacant positions at the SRC by-elections and we won two more seats, gaining a total of 3 seats out of the ten seats available. This win is a vote of confidence in DASO which was launched on campus earlier this year. It shows the great strides we have made as young South Africans and the belief students have in our organization. TVET colleges have been greatly failed by government in terms of resource allocation and funding, students face great difficulty in receiving their study fees, transport and book allowances. The campus lacks the necessary infrastructure and resources to provide quality tertiary education to students. DASO will continue the fight for students to have fair access to quality education and we will ensure that they have the necessary support to achieve in their academic endeavours. The DA congratulates the three DASO SRC Council members and wish them all the best as they reposition campus politics at Taletso TVET College in the service of students.

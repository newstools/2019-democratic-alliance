The Democratic Alliance (DA) wishes the Springboks the best of luck for the 2019 Rugby World Cup Tournament. The tournament starts with the host nation Japan playing against Russia, today. Our first challenge will be a massive one as we take on our arch-rivals, New Zealand – in what promises to be a mouthwatering clash on Saturday. The DA and the entire nation is rallying behind the boys in green and gold, under the captainship of Siya Kolisi. We hope that they can emulate the class of 1995 and 2007 and bring the Web Ellis trophy home. We are more than optimistic about Springbok’s prospects ahead of these encounters. We have seen what happens each time the Springboks lifts the Rugby World Cup – they have brought the country together with renewed hope and true sense of togetherness. Go out there and make the country proud.

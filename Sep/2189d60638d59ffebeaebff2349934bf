I have today written to Trade & Industry Minister, Ebrahim Patel calling on him to make an urgent Executive Statement to the National Assembly on the progress being made towards a post-BREXIT deal between the United Kingdom and South Africa. By all accounts, it appears that the UK is set to crash out of the European Union without a deal which could have massive consequences for South Africaâ€™s economy, our exports, especially in the agricultural and financial sector and jobs in these sectors. Currently, South Africa is able to export R64 billion worth of goods, R10 billon coming from the Western Cape in industries like fruit and wine through the EU customs union, duty free. Once the UK leaves the EU, this preferential trade could be at risk due to the non-finalisation of a roll over deal between the UK and Southern African Customs Union. With the clock ticking towards BREXIT on 31 October 2019, time is running out to provide certainly for South African manufacturers and farmers and that is why Minister Patel must update the nation through Parliament. Ultimately, it will be Members of Parliament that will have to ratify any deal between the UK and South Africa to safeguard our export interests and that is why it is now incumbent to take the House into the Minister confidence to ensure we protect our job creating industries.

The DA Youth Federal Leadership will be visiting all provinces to have internal dialogues with local leadership. The topics of discussion will relate to the crisis of unemployment and inadequate support from the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) in helping young people open small businesses. It cannot be that young people in this country are amongst the highest unemployed people in the country. Furthermore, it is an indictment on the ANC that graduates are unable find jobs. Young people we need to stand up for our future. It’s starts today and now. The DA Youth is the only youth organisation which shows commitment to young people and who is actively engaging with provinces to create local policy which we can present to government. As the leadership, we will petition DA governments to take our policy onboard and implement it in governments which we lead. The tours will internal meetings will take place on the below dates at our provincial head offices: 31 August – Gauteng 2 September – Northern Cape 6 September – Eastern Cape 7 September – KwaZulu Natal 8 September – North West 14 September – Free State 21 September – Mpumalanga 28 September – Western Cape The youth created policy on critical issues will be publicised at the end of the consultation process.

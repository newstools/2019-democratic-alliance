In Tuesday’s Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and People with Disabilities, Members were informed that both the National Youth Development Agency’s (NYDA) CEO and Chairperson have personal drivers. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is dismayed by this revelation considering the fact that young people who are unemployed rely on the NYDA to find assistance to enter the jobs market. The NYDA’s mandate is to “facilitate and provide employment opportunities for youth in order to improve the inclusion of young people in the economy, through increased job creation, entrepreneurship and business support, as well as skills development”. It is unconscionable that its executives are living plush lives, in a country where 32.3% of young people are struggling to gain access to employment. The DA, in committee, requested that the Department investigate how and why these personal drivers were approved for the NYDA Chairperson and CEO. It is shocking that the NYDA places personal privileges of executives above the interest of the youth sector which finds itself in a dire situation. In a Committee meeting on Wednesday, 21 August 2019,  it was revealed that the NYDA only has 3 of the 7 board members required to make decisions. This means the NYDA is currently incapable of making lawfully binding decisions rendering its day-to-day operations useless and ineffective. It is time for the NYDA to take its mandate seriously. We call on them to re-focus on the matters affecting young people. With the increase of unemployment, the lack of access to education and young people in rural areas it is important that privileges are set aside to focus on the genuine struggles of young people – in the main being unemployment.

On behalf of the Democratic Alliance (DA) I would like to pay tribute to all the women in our nation and wish them a very special Women’s Day. We dare never forget as a country the contribution that women made to the struggle for freedom. The DA also recognises that 25 years into democracy, women remain worst affected by poverty, violence and abuse. This is why the party’s Women’s Day celebrations throughout the country today will be dedicated to the fight against gender based violence and an improvement in policing to make sure that we abolish violent crimes against women. Let us build economic models that ensure that more woman are able to participate in the work space. There must be an equal payment for the work that woman do as per their male counterparts. Our society will face technological developments, climate change and will require a new way of managing healthcare. It’s critical that we make these transitions into the future so that our country becomes more inclusive with our young girls able to code, participate in the green economy and ultimately be benefactors of quality healthcare. Let’s build a society where woman are safe, prosperous and leaders in our society.

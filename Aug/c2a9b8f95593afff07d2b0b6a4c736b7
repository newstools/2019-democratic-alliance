The Demoratic Alliance (DA) would like to wish all people of the Muslim faith a happy and safe Eid al-Adha. We hope that this holy day will be joyous and filled with blessings for our Muslim brothers and sisters. Eid al-Adha, is also known as the “Festival of Sacrifice”, and marks the end of Hajj for the millions of people who travel long distances to Mecca every year and pray in solidarity with the world for peace and prosperity The holy day of Eid al-Adha is also a time when the Muslim community celebrates and reflects with family, friends and their communities. To all our brothers and sisters who embarked on the holy Hajj pilgrimage – we trust that it was a spiritually fulfilling journey that will bring love and happiness in their lives. The Muslim community has made significant contributions and sacrifices in our quest to bring about change for our nation. We are indeed better together as South Africans, united in our diversity. Eid al-Adha Mubarak!

The Democratic Alliance (DA) Abroad is taking the fight for a capable Home Affairs service at Diplomatic Missions, straight to Parliament. The lack of effective services for citizens living abroad has left many South Africans in dire situations, including the refusal of health care, travel restrictions and loss of business opportunities. During Â an oversight inspection at the Diplomatic Mission in London, DA Member of Parliament Darren Bergman observed the challenges South Africans abroad face at diplomatic missions, first-hand. It is for this reason, the DA in Parliament will pose a question to the Minister of International Relations & Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, in Parliament on 28 August 2019 on what her Department plans to do to fix diplomatic missions abroad to ensure that South Africans living overseas have access to health care and can travel home. Support for this cause championed by the DA has received increasing waves of support, particularly through our petition for a capable Home Affairs. The petition is a commitment to South Africans that the DA will fight in Parliament for: To join us in this campaign for improved Home Affairs services, sign our petition here. With numerous signatures, we can place a motion of notice in parliament to present the petition and request a debate on the type and quality of services delivered at Diplomatic Missions.

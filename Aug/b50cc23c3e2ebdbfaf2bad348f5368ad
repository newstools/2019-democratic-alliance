 Now more than ever, we need young people to help South Africa overcome its challenges and the Democratic Alliance (DA) remains committed to developing the leaders of today and tomorrow. As such, we are proud to announce that applications for the DA’s Young Leaders Programme Class of 2020 are now open until 9 September 2019 at 5pm. Now in its 13th year of existence, the Young Leaders Programme counts among its graduates over 60 DA Public Representatives currently serving the South African public as Members of Parliament, Members of Provincial Legislatures, Provincial Ministers, Mayors and Members of the Mayoral Committee. What is the DA Young Leaders Programme? The Young Leaders Programme is the DA’s intensive, yearlong, part-time political leadership development course. It strives to give passionate, young South African leaders the opportunity to develop themselves to their full potential, irrespective of their background. What do we look for in a potential Young Leader? Young South African leaders between the ages of 18 and 35 who are already making a difference where they are. They are committed to not only bringing about change in their communities, but to also growing and developing their own potential. Young Leaders are able to align their own personal value set to the DA’s liberal values, and are passionate about creating a better South Africa, considering politics and government as a serious career option for their own future.

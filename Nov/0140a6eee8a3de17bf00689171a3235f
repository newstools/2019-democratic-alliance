The Democratic Alliance (DA) has taken note of the arrest of former State Security Minister and ANC MP, Bongani Bongo, by the Hawks on Thursday morning. Reports indicate that his arrest is in relation to his alleged attempts to bribe the evidence leader in Parliament’s Eskom Inquiry, Advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara. The DA welcomes this action by the Hawks as we have always maintained that Bongo had a case to answer for. In fact, on 22 November 2017, the DA Interim Leader, John Steenhuisen, laid criminal charges against Bongo in terms of the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act. These charges related directly to the allegations that Bongo offered Advocate Vanara a bribe in exchange for stepping down as evidence leader in the Inquiry. We have always held the view that the then Minister’s actions were a gross violation of the law and his oath as a Member of the Executive. It is no secret that Bongo was a critical acolyte in the Guptas’ and Jacob Zuma’s State Capture mafia. And yet, despite this, the ANC outrageously awarded him, and the likes of Faith Muthambi, Mosebenzi Zwane, and Supra Mahumapelo, with Parliamentary Chairpersonships. Bongo is but one of many State Capture foot soldiers who actively participated in the selling off of our country and we can only hope that his arrest will be the first of many.

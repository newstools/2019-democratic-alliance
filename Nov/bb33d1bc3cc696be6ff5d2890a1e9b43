Please find attached soundbite in English by Phumzile Van Damme. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply saddened by the passing of veteran radio and TV personality Xolani Gwala, who passed at the age of 44. We send our heartfelt condolences to his family, friends, and the entire media fraternity. Gwala was a feature in the daily lives of South Africans for more than two decades. He was an excellent broadcaster with an unparalleled work ethic which earned him respect in the industry. He was a highly skilled interviewer, who was able to finesse the truth out of many a politician, CEO or charlatans. He has was as firm as he was fair. Even during his long battle with cancer, Xolani never seized to show love and selflessness – he always endeavored to make a difference. The broadcasting fraternity has lost a great icon and is now poorer without him. He will be deeply missed. Rest in eternal peace, Xolani. Hamba kahle, Mphephethwa.

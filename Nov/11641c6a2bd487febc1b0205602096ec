Please find an attached soundbite in English and Afrikaans by Willem Faber MP, the DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Sport Arts and Culture. The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to wish the Springboks all the best ahead of their clash against England in the 2019 Rugby World Cup Final in Japan. The Boks have made the nation immensely proud and is now just one game away from lifting the William Webb-Ellis trophy for the third time. We are very proud of their achievements as the road to the final was never going to be easy. England has shown on many occasions that they are a force to be reckoned with, but we trust with the players selected by Rassie for this encounter we should be able to push through and bring the trophy home. Tomorrow’s final is reminiscent of the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final when South Africa defeated the English 15-6 in France. The DA trusts that Saturday’s final will be a repeat of that historic night in Paris. We urge South Africans to wear their green and gold jerseys with pride tomorrow. To the Springboks we say all the best and be assured that millions of South Africans will stand firmly behind you in this final encounter. All the best Bokke!

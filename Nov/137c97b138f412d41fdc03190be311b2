The Executive Mayor of the City of Tshwane, Cllr Stevens Mokgalapa, is pleased the ratings affirmation of a stable (Ba1) outlook for the City’s credit profile provided by Moody’s this week. Moody’s has reaffirmed that the City’s (Ba1/Not Prime (NP) stable) reflects “improving operating performance, declining debt and steadily rising liquidity”. This is a vote of confidence in the DA-led administration’s focus of financial stability and accelerated service delivery. This positive outlook for the City’s short and long term performance is an encouragement for the administration to continue to uphold the highest standards of efficient and sustainable solutions for clean governance. Indeed there’s room for improvement [and improved ratings] with specific reference to improving liquidity and continued strong operating performance. Mayor Mokgalapa takes this opportunity to hail the hard work and dedication of the City’s leadership that keeps the administration on a positive growth trajectory.

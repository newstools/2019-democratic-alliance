The Democratic Alliance (DA) takes note of the serious allegations made against the DA-led City of Tshwane Executive Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for transport Councillor Sheila Senkubuge, claimed to be supported by an audio clip that is being widely distributed. The DA’s political leadership will meet with the mayor whilst the DA’s Federal Legal Commission has been tasked to conduct an internal investigation into the matter. Mayor Mokgalapa has laid charges of extortion and invasion of privacy against some known and unknown individuals at the Brooklyn police station as well as with the Hawks. The DA is committed to provide clean governance and will act appropriately when such serious allegations arise. Accordingly, we will handle this matter with all due diligence.

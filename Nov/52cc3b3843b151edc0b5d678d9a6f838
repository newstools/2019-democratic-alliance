The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes and welcomes the ruling by the Western Cape High Court sentencing Luyanda Botha to three life terms in prison for raping and killing Uyinene Mrwetyana. We wish Uyinene’s family and loved ones strength during this time. Botha’s sentencing will not bring her back or take away the trauma they have suffered but the DA hopes that it will at least bring some level of justice and closure. The DA believes that Botha’s sentencing is justice served and we trust that it will send a strong message, that committing heinous crimes against South African women and children is an intolerable offence which deserves nothing less than the strongest possible sentence. Uyinene’s tragic death was a watershed moment for our nation and a stark reminder that South Africa still has a long way to go to address the scourge of Gender-Based Violence. For far too long, South African women and children have been living under perpetual siege as predators of vile acts of sexual assault and violence have terrorized communities unabated. South African women have suffered far too long, and they can no longer continue to suffer in silence due to the inaction of a callous Government. The DA will continue to fight for the rights and safety of women and children in our country.

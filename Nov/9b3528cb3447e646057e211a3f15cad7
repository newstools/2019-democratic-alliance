The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is on the verge of collapse. The City has been brought to its knees by the UDM’s Mayor, Cllr Mongameli Bobani, and his coalition of corruption consisting of the UDM, ANC, AIC, PA and the United Front. Since his election as Mayor in September 2018 Nelson Mandela Bay has regressed on all governance, financial and service delivery indicators. The controversial drain cleaning tender awarded in December 2018, commonly known as the ‘Great Drain Heist’, has allegedly been linked to the killings of at least 18 people. It is strongly suspected that these killings are politically motivated in a City now governed by fear and retribution. To make matters worse Day Zero has arrived in parts of Nelson Mandela Bay with dam levels at critically low levels and no plan from the Mayor to deal with this crisis. Between September 2018 to present, the coalition of corruption has devastated the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality:  In stark contrast, the DA-led government achieved the following successes between 2016 and 2018: The DA has written to President Ramaphosa, the Minister for COGTA, the Premier of the Eastern Cape and MECs yet our please have fallen on deaf ears. The situation in NMB is a national crisis which threatens to destabilize a major Metropolitan Municipality and the ANC government has failed to provide leadership. Considering the critical situation in NMB I will be convening a task team of DA Members of Parliament to focus on interventions that can rescue Nelson Mandela Bay from the coalition of corruption. It is time to dismantle the ‘Gangster State’ in Nelson Mandela Bay and resort good governance to the people.

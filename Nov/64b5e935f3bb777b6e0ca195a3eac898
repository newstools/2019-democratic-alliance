The Democratic Alliance (DA) sends our heartfelt congratulations to the Springboks on a historic victory against England today to clinch the 2019 Rugby World Cup trophy in Japan. The Boks outplayed the English and beat them 32-12. The Boks, lifted the William Webb-Ellis trophy for a record matching 3rd time, a remarkable feat only previously achieved by New Zealand. This World Cup win comes at a time when South Africa is at the edge of the precipice —a nation reeling from deep divisions and in desperate need of a renewed sense of togetherness. The 2019 Rugby World Cup has been a highly anticipated event for South Africans and we thank the team for once again reminding the nation that we are indeed #StrongerTogether and of our shared commitment to building a united and diverse South Africa. The Boks have reinvigorated and revived our collective pride for our young nation and have shown us what can be achieved when we all pull together to attain a common goal. The DA would like to send commiserations to the runners-up England, who displayed great professionalism and athleticism and competed in a manner that their whole nation can be proud of. Congratulation once again to the Boks, this victory truly transcends the rugby fields and is an important tool that we can use towards building South Africa to what we all know she can be – a beautiful nation united in diversity. The nation is beaming without pride and we look forward to the return of the team as we are sure that they will return home to a hero’s welcome!

The following speech was delivered in Parliament’s Appropriation Bill Debate. Parliament has a duty to actually engage with the budgets it is asked to pass by the Executive. It is not a rubber stamp. If we are concerned about the size of the national debt, we have the power to change it. If we are concerned about cuts to basic services, we have the power to change it. Parliament has not taken this responsibility seriously this year. It has rushed through the budget votes, and held only one day of public hearings. We have spent a month on this budget, 34 budget debates and 32 committee meetings. We’ve collectively spent at least 160 hours debating this budget. In all of this Parliament has not come up with a single amendment. Not one. After all of that, our collective position is that we agree with every Rand of the Executive’s budget proposals. This is not the work of an active Parliament. It is the work of a rubber stamp. “Bail out Budget” So today we are being asked to pass a “bail out budget” that includes deep cuts to basic services for the poor, in order to fund another bailout for Eskom. Where is it coming from? When the ANC votes ‘yes’ to this budget, they will be voting ‘yes’ to: Next time you hear the ANC speak about its care for the poor, or even its commitment to a developmental state, just read this ‘bailout budget’ and see what a lie it is. Nearly every basic service on which the poor rely will be cut to fund this bailout budget. The DA’s Amendments The ANC in the Appropriations Committee also rejected the amendments offered by the DA, to redirect money from wasteful and unnecessary programmes back to basic services. We proposed 8 amendments, all of which were budget neutral. That is the truth of this budget. It is a budget which takes directly from the services the poor needs most, to fund the costs and the debts incurred by state capture at Eskom. It is a bailout budget, with the poor doing all of the bailing out. This budget should be rejected.

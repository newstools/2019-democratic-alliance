The Democratic Alliance mourns the death of Springbok legend, James Small. Small, who was part of the legendary Springbok team of 1995, will be remembered for his courageous and fierce spirit on the rugby field. Small and the class of ’95 played an integral part during one of South Africa’s darkest periods. We will never forgot his role in our country’s transition to democracy, non-racialism and reconciliation. South Africa has truly lost a great rugby giant and we will never know the likes of him again. Small proudly wore the Green and Gold Jersey 60 times, and scored 27 tries for his country. The DA sends our heartfelt condolences to Small’s family and loved ones as well as the international rugby fraternity.

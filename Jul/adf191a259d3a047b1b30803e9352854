The Democratic Alliance (DA) is concerned about reports of a protracted go-slow strike action, that Transnet claims is illegal. This strike action has gone on for the past 13 days at Transnet’s Port of Ngqura, allegedly due to dissatisfaction about promotions in the service. The DA will write to Transnet to request an urgent update on developments at the Port of Ngqura, and how the entity plans to address this strike action. While we recognise the democratic right of workers to embark on a legal strike action, we are deeply concerned that 13 days have passed without a solution. Volkswagen, an employer of 6 000 workers, has been the hardest hit by this strike action, and it has reportedly lost 400 of its 680 production units per day. A protracted “go slow” of this level, will have devastating effects, not only on the 6 000 currently employed by Volkswagen, but also on the other major industries which depend on the port. Should this go-slow continue, we risk companies taking their business to more stable and reliable shores. Strong and decisive leadership is needed at Transnet to avert what could potentially result in loss of valuable jobs and revenue. In a country of over 10 million unemployed people, the last thing we need is an avoidable action that could threaten job security of more 6 000 people.

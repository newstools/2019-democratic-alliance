The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply  saddened by the passing of Johnny Clegg. South Africa and the world mourn a cultural icon whose influence spans decades. Indeed a giant has fallen – Johny Clegg was one of the few South African musicians whose music was able to unite people across cultural and racial backgrounds, as well as tie different generations together. His contribution to the the Struggle for a Democratic South Africa through song will always ring dearly in our hearts. We wish his family, friends and fans our deepest and heartfelt condolences during this time. Johnny Clegg may have played his last note but his music will live forever.

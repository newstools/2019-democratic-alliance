Today, the Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip, John Steenhuisen, spent his 67 minutes for Nelson Mandela Day cooking soup for the homeless with Ladles of Love.

Further, the DA’s members of Parliament in the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces collected and donated goods for The Homestead. See photos here, and here. The Homestead has various projects aimed at providing for the needs of street children, including a drop-in centre and shelters in Khayelitsha and Manenberg. The DA believes that Nelson Mandela Day provides an opportunity for South Africans to come together in the spirit of ubuntu and reach out to make a difference in each others’ lives.

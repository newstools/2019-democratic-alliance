The Democratic Alliance (DA) celebrates with the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at this historic moment in their democratic history following the announcement of the 2018 election results. The people of the DRC have paid in blood, sweat and tears to see a day when the results of their democratic elections would reflect the true will of the people, and when a free and fair election process could bring about a democratic transfer of power from the ruling party. The election of an opposition leader to the nation’s presidency brings hope to us all and fuels the faith of the African people in the democratic process. This momentous outcome will surely reverberate across the continent as more than a dozen African countries hold national elections in 2019. We know that the reality is that the work of healing the nation after all the violence and repression will be the work of a generation. No one leader can or should be expected to bring about total restoration overnight. The DA’s hope for the DRC is for the transition to be peaceful, and for the elected opposition to rise to the challenge of ushering in a peaceful and prosperous new period in the life of that nation. As South Africans prepare for our own national and provincial elections this year, the DRC serves as an inspiration to us. It is a reminder that a democratic transfer of power is possible in Africa and that we can rid our continent of old and corrupt leadership as we will seek to do in South Africa in the upcoming election.

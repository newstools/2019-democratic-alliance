The protest today by relatives of Life Esidimeni victims outside Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s office is justified because there has been an inexcusable delay in paying them financial compensation according to Justice Dikgang Moseneke’s arbitration ruling. They were promised the payments by 10 December last year, but Premier Makhura has yet again failed to give this top priority. His failure is a combination of arrogance and incompetence as technical issues are cited for the delay. A further problem is that an inadequate amount has been budgeted for to pay out more than 200 claimants. Justice Moseneke ruled that R1 million be paid to each claimant for constitutional damages, R180 000 for emotional trauma, and R20 000 for funeral expenses for those who died. This means that R1.2 million will be paid to relatives of those who died, and R1 180 000 to relatives of patients who survived. Payouts to 200 claimants would cost about R236 million, but only R118 million was allocated in the Adjustment Budget in November last year. Every effort should be made to conclude the payouts instead of weak excuses that perpetuate the Esidimeni trauma.

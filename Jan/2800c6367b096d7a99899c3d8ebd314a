The Democratic Alliance (DA) condemns the barbaric murder of civilians believed to have been carried out by the terrorist group Al-Shabaab. The nation of Kenya has been a committed partner in the efforts to bring peace to Somalia within the African Union. For these efforts they have been repeatedly targeted by this terrorist organization. We call on all nations of the African Union to supply every possible resource to assist Kenya in attaining justice for this atrocity, and in the work that will follow to rebuild and to heal this devastating wound. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all who lost loved ones, all who were wounded, and the Republic of Kenya as a whole.

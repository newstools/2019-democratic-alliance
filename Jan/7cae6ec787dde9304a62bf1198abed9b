Democratic Alliance (DA) information tables were presented with evidence this morning by Bonteheuwel and Valhalla Park residents who showed the party food vouchers being handed out by the ACDP in exchange for votes in the Ward 31 by-election. Please see the voucher here. ACDP activists violated the Electoral Act by intercepting voters outside the polling station and on street corners and offering them food vouchers in exchange for their vote. They were placing ACDP stickers in the ID books of voters coming to the polling station and upon exit from the polling station handing out food vouchers to these voters. See photo here. The vouchers contain small print that indicates that it can be redeemed for food on Saturday. This is a violation of the Electoral Act. The DA’s Malusi Booi and JP Smith lodged formal charges with the IEC, who confirmed that they were investigating the matter. Click here for the charges. “Ample and clear evidence exists that the ACDP breached the Electoral Act and as Regional Chairperson of the DA I am calling for the ACDP to be expelled from the by-election, for their election result which is based on fraud to be withdrawn from the outcome and that the name of the ACDP be withdrawn from the ballot papers in the upcoming national and provincial elections,” Grant Twigg, Regional Chairperson of the DA, stated. Twigg added: “Our democracy was too hard won to allow the ACDP to insult voters from the Cape Flats with the notion that their electoral voice can be bought or drowned out for the cost of a food voucher. This is an insult to voters who saw their voices trampled under the apartheid regime and who do not need the ACDP to repeat this insult by cheating them out of their electoral rights.” “We are calling for the IEC to expel these cheating ACDP politicians from the election as they have betrayed our democracy”. Photographic and video evidence of the fraud and well as the contact details of victims thereof, are available upon request.

Please find attached a soundbite in Afrikaans. Last week the Democratic Alliance (DA) unveiled a billboard, “The ANC is Killing Us”, in memory of all those who have tragically lost their lives due to an indifferent ANC government. Our billboard is about justice and commemoration for the many South Africans who paid the ultimate price, their lives, at the hands of the callous ANC. Among the communities who have suffered the most, have been South Africa’s forgotten rural communities. Over the past 6 years more than 3119 violent farms attacks have taken place resulting in the deaths of hundreds of farmers and farm workers. The failing ANC’s lack of political will to address rural safety is killing our rural communities. The DA has long maintained that the failing ANC’s decision to disband the rural safety unit was reckless and has left rural South Africans vulnerable. Something needs to be done urgently as rural communities live in constant fear for their lives. The DA reiterates our call that the government needs to implement specialised police rural units to fill the vacuum left by the local units in rural areas. This vacuum has now been filled by criminals and those who seek to prey on rural and vulnerable South Africans. A DA led government will immediately reintroduce honest and professional specialised crime fighting units to successfully prevent and investigate specific crime such as rural farm attacks, murder, rape, robbery and stock theft. To ensure that proactive policing is also given as much assistance as possible, a Rural Crime Intelligence Component would also be established as part of the SAPS’s Crime Intelligence Division. The DA is committed to build one South Africa for All where rural communities are safe and protected.

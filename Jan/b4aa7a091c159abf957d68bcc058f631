During his illustrious career, Phil Masinga earned more than 50 caps for Bafana Bafana and he scored the famous goal that won South Africa a place in the 1998 Soccer World Cup. He was also part of the team that won the African Cup of Nations in 1996. Affectionately known as ‘Chippa’, Masinga’s extraordinary talent went beyond borders as he enjoyed a successful run as a striker for Leeds United. Masinga has left an indelible mark in the sporting fraternity and he serves as an inspiring example to us all that one’s background should not hinder how far they go in life. The DA extends its condolences to Masinga’s family and all who knew him during this time. His passing is a tragic loss for our country and he will be sorely missed. Lala ngoxolo Shobane, you have run your race.

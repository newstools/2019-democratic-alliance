The DA Federal Executive has, this past weekend, reviewed the party’s prospects in the upcoming elections in Gauteng and we remain convinced that the ANC’s dismal record of empty promises, endemic fraud and failed delivery means that the we can form the basis of an alternative government that puts the people first after the forthcoming elections. We fully back and are deeply appreciative of Solly Msimanga’s commitment to the people of Gauteng, which was so evidenced by the personal sacrifice he has made in announcing his resignation as the Mayor of Tshwane. Solly is very clear – both Tshwane and the City of Johannesburg can only be fully turned around if the DA governs the entire province. Msimanga will now be freed up to focus his full energy on bringing change to the province and will prioritise fighting corruption; bringing about an honest and professional police service; fighting the scourge of drug abuse; providing fair access to jobs and ensuring that we never have a repeat of the deep injustice that was the Life Esidimeni tragic deaths. The Federal Executive has full confidence in Msimanga as our Premier Candidate. The ANC’s transparent attack on Msimanga is the clearest sign yet that they are rightly concerned about losing the province.

The vandalisation of the commemorative billboard “The ANC is Killing Us” is tarnishing the memory of those who have died under an ANC government. While it is not clear who is responsible for this destruction, it would not be the first time a DA billboard which speaks hard truths is vandalised. In 2016, the DA erected a billboard highlighting the fact that under the failing ANC’s mismanagement of the economy, more and more South Africans have fallen victim to unemployment. This act of destruction is an insult to the memories of the people who died during the avoidable Esidimeni tragedy, Marikana murders and pit toilet deaths. The act of tearing their names is deeply offensive. This billboard is about justice and commemoration for the many South Africans who became the victims of an indifferent, uncaring and cruel government and how so many other painful and horrific events should never have happened in a democratic South Africa. The vandalism of this billboard cannot hide the fact that the ANC is directly responsible for the deaths of countless South Africans due to their callous negligence. It is for this reason; the DA will remain determined in our pursuit for justice for all those who lost their lives. We are committed to building One South Africa for All where the people are put first. We will never forget about these people. South Africa should never forget either.

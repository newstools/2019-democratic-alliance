Find attached soundbites in English and Sesotho by DA Free State Premier Candidate, Patricia Kopane. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has emerged victorious in a highly contested by-election in Ward 47 in Heidedal. The failing ANC’s support dwindled from 40.47% in 2016 to 35.61%.  This is a show of confidence in the DA and that the people of the Free State are voting for change. South Africans are rejecting corruption, maladministration, looting and political infighting which have been brought about by the failing ANC government. The people can no longer be taken for granted and are choosing the DA because we prioritise quality services. This victory is a clear sign that the DA as the only party that can bring Change, provide services, create jobs, and ensure that citizens live in safe communities. This by-election follows the resignation of a former DA councillor who was under investigation for a case of misconduct. This emphasises the fact that the DA has zero tolerance for misconduct and that the party has high expectations from its public representatives. The results prove that the DA has grown exponentially in areas where the ANC dominated proving once again that we are growing everywhere in the province. As we head to 2019, we are committed to building One South For All where we can change the lives of the people for the better. The DA encourages citizens to choose the DA as we are the only party that can take South Africa forward.

The Democratic Alliances (DA) joins the people of Zimbabwe and the world’s jazz fraternity in mourning the death of world-renowned jazz legend, Oliver ‘Tuku’ Mtukudzi. His untimely passing leaves a void that will not be easy to fill. His death comes almost exactly a year after the passing of another jazz luminary, Bra Hugh Masekela. Africa and the world’s music industry will take a while to recover from the loss of towering figures in the mould of Mtukudzi and Masekela. Mtukudzi was one of the greatest talents ever to emerge from Africa. The soul and sincerity of his music came from the fact that he mostly sang in his mother tongue of Shona, which transcended cultures and serenaded fans all over the world. We extend our condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of Tuku. May his music live forever. Tinoti famba zvakanaka mwana wevhu, pako wasakura wazunza. Zorora murugare Oliver Mtukudzi.

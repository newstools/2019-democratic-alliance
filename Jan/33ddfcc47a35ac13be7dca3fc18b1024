The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to thank all South Africans who came out in their numbers to register for change during the final registration weekend ahead of the 2019 General Elections. The DA is pleased by the Independent Electoral Commission’s (IEC) operations across the country this past weekend, however, we remain concerned about incidents of violence and intimidation at a number of registration stations. The DA maintains that a voter’s power to change the status quo is through the ballot box. This is the only way we can ensure that liars and looters are kicked out of office. Further to this, preliminary numbers, especially in Gauteng and the Northern Cape, indicate that the people of South Africa are ready to vote for real change that builds One South Africa for All. The DA is committed to building One South Africa for All and we will ensure that South Africans have access to jobs, we will speed up the provision of service delivery, introduce an honest and professional police service, root out corruption and secure our borders.

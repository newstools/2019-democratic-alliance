Overall the Democratic Alliance (DA) is happy with the Independent Electoral Commission’s (IEC) operations across the country however we are deeply concerned about incidents in Vuwani, Krugersdorp and Stutterheim, where protest action is keeping voters from registering to vote. We call on the IEC and the South African Police Service (SAPS) to defuse tensions and ensure that these stations remain open to enable the free movement of voters. The DA is closely monitoring Day 1 of the Voter Registration Weekend, from, Nkululeko House, our Campaign Headquarters in Johannesburg. The DA is present in every community today, mobilising the people of South Africa to register and assisting voters to register. We are receiving unprecedented approaches from voters through our party agents, contact centres, local offices and social media channels – and we are assisting all of these voters to register today. This is truly the last chance for voters to register for Election 2019, and voters must take this opportunity to register and check their address details today and tomorrow, Sunday 27 January. The time is now, and Election 2019 is too important for incorrect registration to keep anyone from voting. Ultimately the power to vote for real change and usher in a new government that puts the people first is in the hands of voters. The most powerful protest action takes place at the ballot box. There is a real urgency, for all people to come out and register to help us to bring change and to build One South Africa for All. Ours is a hard-won freedom, which we should never take for granted. And that implies a duty to participate in Elections, by registering to vote. We call on South Africans over the age of 16 to all to get to their voting station, and to do everything possible to register this weekend. Every effort should be made to register to vote. The power is in the hands of the people to vote in a government that puts them first and takes South Africa in the right direction.

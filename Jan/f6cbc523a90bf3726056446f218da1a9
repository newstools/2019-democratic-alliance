ANC national spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa, has reportedly stated that the party will not account for its members who have been implicated in corruption and wrongdoing in their personal capacities. This admission proved beyond any doubt that the ANC is not even prepared to pay lip service to a fight against corruption. This admission comes a week after the party launched its manifesto which promises to: “put an end to state capture, restore the integrity of public institutions and tackle corruption”. There was never any intention to abide by these commitments in the manifesto. We have seen this with the issue of prescribed assets and the independence of the reserve which the governing party wants to tinker with. This will no doubt have catastrophic consequences to the country’s economy which is already on its knees. The ANC is quite simply the same bus filled with empty promises being driven by a different driver who has no power to steer the party in the right direction. The very same people who terrorized this country by looting the public purse are still calling the shots under President Ramaphosa. This is why there will never be any policy certainty within the organization. Over the past week, the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture once again revealed how deep the rot of corruption truly runs in the ANC. They do not care about integrity and good governance, they care about looting and lining their own pockets. The DA is the only party big enough to truly clean out the rot of corruption in our institutions and most importantly the only party that is truly committed to the fight against the cancer of corruption that is killing South Africa. We have demonstrated this within our own organisation. Under a DA government any person found guilty of corruption will  be sentenced to 15 year in prison.

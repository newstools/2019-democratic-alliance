The Democratic Alliance and the ANC are neck-and-neck in Gauteng, with 3 hours left for this last registration weekend. This once again proves that the people of Gauteng are sick and tired of the ANC’s corruption and empty promises. This 2019 National Elections the blue wave of change will sweep through Gauteng because the people of this province now know the DA’s governance record. We will never be complacent. We will work hard to demonstrate that we are the only party that can truly build One South Africa for All. A DA-led provincial government will bring tangible change to Gauteng. We will speed up the provision of service delivery, introduce an honest and professional police service, root out corruption, secure our borders and ensure fair access to jobs. We urge the people of Gauteng to use the opportunity of the last remaining hours to register in order to bring about change come Election Day.

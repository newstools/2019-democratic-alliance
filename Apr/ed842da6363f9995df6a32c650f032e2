The Democratic Alliance (DA) congratulates the people of Sudan for their tenacity and courage which has resulted in the removal from power of President Omar Al-Bashir. We have seen iconic images of women leading these protests which, quite literally, took the fight to Al-bashirâ€™s doorstep and won. In 2016 the Supreme Court of Appeals found that the failure of the South African government to arrest Omar Al-Bashir during a visit to South Africa was unlawful. The people of Sudan could have been freed from the rule of the genocidal Al-Bashir sooner had South Africa complied with its obligations under the Rome Statute. The history of the ANC government supporting oppressive regimes against their citizens is now repeating itself in Venezuela. The victory of the Sudanese should serve as a timely reminder to never again find ourselves on the wrong side of history. As we share in the joy of the Sudanese people, we must remember our aspiration to be a moral voice in global politics and reaffirm our commitment to a foreign policy grounded in the constitutional values of freedom, equality and human dignity. The DA trusts that the removal of Al-Bashir will usher in a new democratic dispensation in the country.

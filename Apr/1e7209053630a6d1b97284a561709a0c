The DA received feedback
from the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, General
Sitole, stating that he will monitor the investigation into the case opened by
myself, against the ANC for instigating violence in Alexandra, with the purpose
of influencing the outcome of the Elections on 8 May. General Stole indicated in
his letter to me that he will monitor the investigation and provide feedback on
the progress made. Since the case was opened, more evidence has emerged from
investigations by the JMPD into allegations that ANC members coordinated
protest action and violence in Alexandra. In a search operation by the JMPD, an
ANC branded vehicle loaded with old tyres was discovered. It is suspected that these tyres
were intended for barricading roads as part of the shutdown. One of the
occupants in the vehicle who was arrested is a known ANC member. Based on this new
evidence, I call on
General Sitole to personally ensure a swift and efficient investigation by the
SAPS into ANC instigated violence in order to guarantee a safe and peaceful
election on 8 May. It has become clear that the ANC is feeling increasingly
uncertain about an election victory on 8 May and are desperately trying to
cling to power. It is however a shame that the ANC will choose to resort to
violence in an attempt to retain power. The people of Gauteng
are ready to vote for real change led by an honest and caring DA government.

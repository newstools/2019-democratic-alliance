On behalf of the Democratic Alliance, I would like to wish all members of the Jewish faith a kosher and blessed time as they celebrate the eight days of Passover. Pesach is an important time in the Jewish calender, a time for the Jewish community to commemorate and celebrate the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. It is a time when families come together to celebrate freedom and the deliverance from oppression. This year, the first night of Pesach falls on 19 April, which is also Good Friday for Christians. It is auspicious that the first night of Passover and Good Friday both fall on the same day this year. In this important time of reflection, may South Africans of all faiths become more accepting and tolerant of our differences. May we celebrate our shared humanity, in the knowledge that there is much more that binds us than that separates us. If you are travelling during the long weekend, please drive extra carefully as there is always a heightened risk this time of year, with the roads much busier than usual. Chag Sameach!

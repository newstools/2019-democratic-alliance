On behalf of the Democratic Alliance, I would like to wish all members of the Christian community a happy and blessed time as they celebrate this important period in the Christian calendar. Good Friday and Easter Sunday are a time to remember the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ and to celebrate forgiveness and renewal. It is a time for deep reflection about who we are and how we should best conduct our lives. It is also a time to be with our loved ones and celebrate life and hope for a better world. If you are travelling over the Easter weekend, please be especially careful, as the roads will be very busy. Happy Easter!

It has come to my attention that a case of theft has been opened with the SAPS against my brother Nkululeko Msimanga, this by the City of Tshwane. I have been informed that an investigation is ongoing and I welcome this probe. It is critical that law enforcement gets to the bottom of this matter and if my brother is guilty of any wrongdoing he should bear the consequences of his actions without fear or favour. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has been at the forefront of fighting crime and corruption where we govern and holding the ANC to account where we are in opposition. This is something we are committed to even when it is not expedient or easy to do. That is why I welcome this investigation and hope that the SAPS moves with speed to establish the facts and affect the necessary prosecution.

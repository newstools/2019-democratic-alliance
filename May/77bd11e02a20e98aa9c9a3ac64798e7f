The DA congratulates Cyril Ramaphosa on his swearing in as President of South Africa. This marks the possibility of change that builds One SA for All in the country and I wish him well. If the President does what is in the interest of South Africa and is genuine about economic reform, he will have the full support of the DA. Key cabinet changes that would signal a commitment to reform include: The economic cluster should be reduced to three key ministries to enable more coherent economic policy: finance, state-owned entities and jobs; Where the DA governs, lifestyle audits have already been instituted and we continue to lead governments that are free of corruption. The party firmly believes in protecting the constitution so more citizens can own land going forward. President Ramaphosa will have my full support when he prioritises the national interest over his partyâ€™s interest. Beginning with these reforms would be a huge step in the right direction. We wish the president well.

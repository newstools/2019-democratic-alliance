The Democratic Alliance (DA) is very pleased with the high number of South Africans who have come out to vote. We are closely monitoring the voting process, in an effort to protect the integrity of the election. In this regard we have logged a number of issues with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). We call on the IEC to look into and resolve these incidents as a matter of urgency. The DA is encouraged to see the thousands of South Africans who have been brave and have chosen to give change a chance, in many parts of the country braving the cold and the rain in so doing. The people of South Africa are desperate for change, and they know that the DA is the only party that can bring true, tangible change that will turn things around for all South Africans. The DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, and all nine DA Premier Candidates have already cast their votes. We urge all South Africans to follow suit and come out in their numbers to vote for a better future. We implore on South Africans who have not yet voted, to take their smart card or the green bar coded South African ID to their nearest voting stations, to cast their votes. Those who do not have their valid ID books can get a temporary ID at the nearest Home Affairs offices or pop up offices which will be open from 07:00-21:00. Voters face a clear choice; more corruption and more empty promises, or they can choose change that deliver One South Africa for All and puts a job in every home.

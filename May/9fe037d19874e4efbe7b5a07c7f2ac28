On behalf of the Democratic Alliance (DA) I would like to wish the Muslim community in South Africa and abroad a blessed Ramadan. As you fast from sunrise to sunset the DA hopes that this will be a time of goodwill and selflessness. South Africaâ€™s tomorrow is better together and I trust you find peace and happiness as we unite in our diversity. Four weeks of blessings to you this Ramadan and may they be filled with health, wealth and joy. I admire the care and giving that characterises this period in your lunar calendar and my prayers and thoughts are with you as the spirit of Ramadan remains in your heart and lights up you soul in the coming month. Ramadan Mubarak!

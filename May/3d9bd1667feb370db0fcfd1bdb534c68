The Democratic Alliance (DA) sends its deepest condolences to the family of Annette Kennealy who was murdered on her farm outside Makhado yesterday morning. Ms Kennealy served the DA as a councillor between 2011 to 2014 and will be remembered for her selfless service and her commitment towards human rights. The DA would further like to express sincere gratitude to the South African Police Service (SAPS) and community institutions for their swift and professional reaction. We hope that those responsible will soon be apprehended and that justice will be served. I personally have known Ms Kennealy for more than 40 years and will remember her for our shared passion of the arts, her sober expression for her love of the country and her love for nature and animals. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ms Kennealy’s  2 daughters, Astrid and Megan, her sister Kim, her mother and immediate family and friends during this difficult time

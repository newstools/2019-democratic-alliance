The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the shocking announcement by the Court of Arbitration for Sport that Caster Semenya has lost her legal case against the athletics governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). This means if Semenya wants to keep running on the international stage, she must take medicines which will reduce her testosterone levels. This IAAF policy is wholly discriminatory to female athletes who happen to have higher testosterone levels in their bodies and no doubt sets an awful precedence for the sport. The DA stands in full support of the remarkably talented Semenya; she undoubtedly is a talented young woman who has made South Africa proud. She has encouraged other young female athletes to participate in sports and to believe in themselves. She has flown our flag high and has consistently raised the bar in the global sports fraternity, despite opposition that has been levelled against her natural abilities. Caster Semenya deserves the right to compete just like all other female athletes before her. The DA calls on the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) and the SA government to provide greater support Caster Semenya, and use all available processes to oppose this decision and fight for her right to compete on the international stage without having to take any drugs to suppress what she was naturally born to do- being a national champion.

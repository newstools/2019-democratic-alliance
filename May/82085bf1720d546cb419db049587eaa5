Note to Editors: Please find attached a soundbite from Solly Malatsi in English, Sepedi and Setswana. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has today received communication from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) that the ANC has laid a complaint against the DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, following comments he made regarding ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, at the Party’s Phetogo Rally on Saturday. Maimane stated that Ramaphosa “is a man who took bribe money from Bosasa and allowed his son to take their money too.” The DA will not apologise, nor will we retract this statement. The fact remains, that Cyril Ramaphosa, received a campaign donation from Bosasa, and after he became President of the Republic, his son, Andile, continued to receive lucrative deals from the corrupt company. Bosasa is a company which is in the business of bribery, looting and plundering from the state and both Ramaphosa and senior ANC members have been fingered in its web of corruption – the full extent of which has been laid bare at the Zondo commission. The evidence presented shows that senior leaders in the ANC, benefited personally from the corrupt Bosasa. The ANC’s complaint against the DA, comes just after the IEC informed us that it would not investigate our complaint that Bosasa had set up “war rooms” for the ANC in the 2011, 2014 and 2016 – showing yet again how close the relationship is between Bosasa and the ANC. The ANC’s complaint will not silence the DA. We will continue to expose Bosasa’s corruption and Ramaphosa’s role in it. If Ramaphosa truly has nothing to hide, he will come forward, come clean and testify before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture without delay.

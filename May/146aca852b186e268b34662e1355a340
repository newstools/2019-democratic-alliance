Please find attached a soundbite from Refiloe Ntsekhe, the Democratic Alliance National Spokesperson. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply saddened by the passing of City Press journalist, Ngwako Modjaji. We convey our condolences, to his family, friends, and colleagues at City Press and the media fraternity at large. It is a fitting tribute that Modjadjiâ€™s final by-line appeared on the front page of the City Press. This speaks to his integrity and commitment to his craft. Modjadji always sought to get the facts right, sometimes even holding a story back because it did not sit right with him. His duty was to convey the news, not involve himself in internal politics. He was quiet in his questioning but firm in his determination to seek the truth. Indeed, he was a truly humble man. Modjadji will be missed by all those who crossed paths with him. May his soul rest in peace.

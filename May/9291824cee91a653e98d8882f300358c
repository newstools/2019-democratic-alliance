This morning, representatives of the Democratic Alliance (DA), Congress of the People (COPE), United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) met to forge a partnership to ensure that the 2019 elections are indeed free and fair. We met in order to agree that the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) conduct an audit of all voting districts where instances of voters voting more than once took place. Furthermore, a random audit of other voting districts must take place, in order to get an overall report of this issue. This proposal was taken to this morningâ€™s National Party Liaison Committee (NPLC), and we are pleased to say that the IEC agreed to proceed with this critical audit. In order to ensure that the audit is transparent and done with integrity, the process will be overseen by Political Parties. When the results are announced, there should be no doubt in the minds of the people of South Africa that the election was not free and fair. We will work closely with all political parties and the IEC in ensuring that the 2019 elections were administered with the highest level of integrity.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) has taken note of the Equality Court ruling dismissing the discrimination case brought against the DA Member of Parliament, Dianne Kohler-Barnard. The allegations leveled against Ms. Kohler-Barnard were of a serious nature and the DA is pleased that this matter was rigorously tested and refuted in Court. We welcome the Equality Court’s ruling and trust that all those involved will respect this outcome. The DA is very glad that the Magistrate was able to see through the contrived and trumped up nature of the allegations made by a disgruntled former staff member. The costs order made against the complainant is a welcome outcome and we hope it will bring to an end the vexatious and frivolous litigation by the former staff member. The DA will not be distracted by those who seek to derail the Democratic Project. Our commitment is the vision of building One South Africa for All, underpinned by our values of Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to extend warm wishes to all those across the country who are observing Diwali. The five-day festival marks the beginning of the new year in the Hindu calendar and provides an opportunity to reflect on the importance of family and friendship. The DA trusts that during this time, we will be reminded of the bonds we share and our joint responsibility to build a united and prosperous South Africa. We hope that the Festival of Lights will provide those who observe with fresh hope, success, and happiness. The DA remains committed to building One South Africa for All united in our diversity.

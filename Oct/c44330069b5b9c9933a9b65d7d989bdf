The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted the resignation of Herman Mashaba as Executive Mayor of Johannesburg. We respect this decision and wish Mr Mashaba all the best with his future endeavours. The resignation of Mr Mashaba as Mayor of Johannesburg does not signal an end to the DA’s commitment to the people of Johannesburg and South Africa. In order to ensure political stability, the DA Federal Executive (FedEx) will urgently convene in order to assess the impact of today’s decision, and how we respond in the best interests of the people of Johannesburg. By any measure, the DA and its coalition partners have made significant progress in turning the City around, specifically in the areas of unlocking opportunities, stopping and acting against corruption, and accelerating the delivery of quality services. In just three short years, the DA-led multiparty coalition government has made huge progress in a number of areas but not limited to: The South African Democratic Project is not an easy one to advance. Which means building a capable state, fighting for non-racialism, pushing for economic redress and inclusion through sustainable programmes, respect for the rule of law. We will not falter in our mission to bring real change to South Africa. We would like to thank Mr Mashaba for his service to the people of Johannesburg.

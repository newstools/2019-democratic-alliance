The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes World Rugbyâ€™s announcement today that the 2022 Sevens Rugby World Cup will be hosted in Cape Town, South Africa. It will be the first time that the event will take place in Africa. The City and the country should be proud of this achievement especially in light of the Springboks playing in the 2019 Rugby World Cup Final. Cape Town was awarded the World Cup tournament after many successful Sevens Series were held in the Mother City over the past number years. The DA, therefore, has full faith that Cape Town will do a great job of turning out a spectacular 2022 Sevens Rugby World Cup.

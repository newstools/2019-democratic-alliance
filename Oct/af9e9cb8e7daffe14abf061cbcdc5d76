The Democratic Alliance (DA) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the Ugandan Government’s plans to reintroduce legislation in the country that would bring the death penalty for homosexuals. This inherently homophobic piece of legislation is utterly deplorable, inhumane and undemocratic. LGBTQIA+ rights are human rights and no person should be discriminated against or lose their lives because of their sexual orientation. The DA trusts that the South African Government will stand with the LGBTQIA+ community in Uganda and the DA in opposition to this appalling bill. As we celebrate Pride Month, the DA remembers the sacrifices the LGBTQIA+ has made not only for liberation of South Africans, but for liberation Africans across our continent. While South Africa has come some way in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights and we still have a long way to go – we need to continue advancing the basic human rights of this community throughout Africa and the world.

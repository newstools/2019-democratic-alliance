The Democratic Alliance (DA) can confirm that the nominations for DA Parliamentary Leader officially closed Friday night at 20:00. I can confirm that the position was uncontested with only one nomination. Therefore the new Parliamentary Leader is John Steenhuisen. The DAâ€™s Parliamentary Caucus looks forward to working with Mr. Steenhuisen and he can be assured of our support.

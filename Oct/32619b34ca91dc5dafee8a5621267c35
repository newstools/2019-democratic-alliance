The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to extend warm Yom Kippur wishes to the Jewish community. Yom Kippur is the holiest day in the Jewish faith and is also known as the Day of Atonement. This holy day is observed through intense fasting and prayer. We trust that this will be a peaceful Yom Kippur filled with love and happiness. On this day, the DA also remembers the sacrifices the Jewish community has made and their role in building a united and diverse South Africa. Gmar hatimah tovah!

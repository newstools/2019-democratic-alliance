Please find attached a soundbite by Phumzile Van Damme here. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is happy to note that the SABC and SuperSport have come to an agreement to broadcast the final game of the 2019 Rugby World Cup between South Africa and England, live on SABC 2 on Saturday the 2nd of November at 11h00. We are pleased that the SABC and SuperSport have been able to come to this agreement as many South African rugby fans, who cannot afford DSTV, have been unable to track the Springboksâ€™ performance throughout the entire World Cup period. The cash-strapped public broadcaster was unable to afford the purchasing of broadcasting rights for the 2019 Rugby World Cup due to its serious financial challenges and years of mismanagement. The DA welcomes this announcement as a unifying and exciting opportunity for nation building. Sport, and rugby in particular, has played a valuable role in bringing South Africans together, and we hope the entire nation supports the Springboks this coming weekend.

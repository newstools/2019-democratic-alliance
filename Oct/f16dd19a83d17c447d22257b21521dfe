The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo would like to congratulate the DA-run Modimolle-Mookgophong Municipality for going paperless.  Henceforth all Council meetings will be going paperless.  This is an initiative by the DA to go green, save the environment and to cut the unnecessary expenditure in an attempt to improve services to the residents within the municipality. The DA can confirm that the Municipality used to print an average of 30 960 copies per month for all Council meetings including Special Council, Executive Committee Meetings (Special and Ordinary), and Portfolio Committee meetings that sit at least once a month. These reports were distributed to all 28 Councillors who are scattered across the four major towns that form part of the Municipality. The Municipality has taken a resolution to go paperless by replacing all the printed papers with a tablet. This will ensure that the municipality plays its part in reducing the adverse effects that printed papers have on the environment. This will also save the municipality approximately R123 100 per month on paper costs, excluding the overtime, petrol and delivery costs. The money saved will be redirected towards service delivery. The DA congratulates the Municipality in honouring its pledge of creating a greener municipality and urges other municipalities to follow in our footsteps to prioritise service delivery. The DA is committed to ensuring that basic services are rendered and will continue to find innovative ways in which the municipality can save money, and protect our environment.

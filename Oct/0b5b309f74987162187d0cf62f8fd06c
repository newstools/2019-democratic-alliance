The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to wish the Class of 2019 well for their final matric examinations. To those who have already completed their practical examinations, we trust that it was a success. In light of the recent rolling blackouts, we hope that the rest of the matric examinations will kick off with a smooth start and that there will be no further interruptions as our learners take this vital step towards unlocking opportunities for themselves. These final examinations can often be a stressful period for matriculants and the DA calls on families, schools and communities to rally around the Class of 2019 to offer them support during this time. At 52.8%, South Africa has the highest youth unemployment rate in the world. For many young people a matric certificate is, therefore, an important stepping stone towards finding employment and breaking the cycle of poverty. We congratulate the Class of 2019, who despite a broken education system and disintegrating socio-economic conditions, beat the odds to make it to this pivotal moment in their academic careers. We hope that all their hard work will pay off come the release of their results.

In a response to a Democratic Alliance (DA) question, the Minister of Tourism, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, confirmed in the National Assembly today that DA-governed Western Cape and the City of Cape Town are the only governments to have additional safety tourism programmes. The National Department of Tourism has introduced the Tourism Safety Monitor Programme in all the provinces.  This programme is being rolled out across the country. However, only the Western Cape and the City of Cape Town have additional programmes to ensure the safety of tourists. The City of Cape Town will roll out the Bank-Aid Programme.  Through Band-Aid the City will provide services such, but not limited to, Trauma counselling, Translation services and assistance with lost or stolen passports and bank cards. In addition, Cape Town has appointed Tourism Safety Ambassadors who serve as additional on-the-ground support in the CBD and other tourism hotspots. They guide visitors around the city, offer advice and keep a keen eye out for any suspicious behavior. It is clear that through these tangible programmes that only the DA-governed Western Cape and the City of Cape Town are serious about ensuring the safety of local and international visitors.  Although all and sundry talk about the importance of the safety of tourists, no other Province is actually doing something about it.  Only the DA, is demonstrating and understands that the safety of tourists are intricately linked to the overall success of tourism in South Africa which is an “easy win” for economic growth and job creation.

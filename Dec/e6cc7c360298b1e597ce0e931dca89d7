The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the Gauteng North High Courtâ€™s decision today that a recent interim order remains in place to nullify all resolutions passed during an illegal takeover of the Tshwane City Council by the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) earlier this month. The court is expected to make a ruling on the illegal removal of DA Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and Speaker Katlego Mathebe on a date to be advised. The DA is delighted that the mayor and speaker will remain in office to continue the good work of the DA in the past three years by delivering quality services to the residents of Tshwane. We respect democratic processes and will not stand for mob politics, which is what the behavior of the ANC and EFF amounted to.

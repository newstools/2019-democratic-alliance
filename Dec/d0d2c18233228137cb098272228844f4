In response to a question by the
Democratic Alliance (DA) in Parliament on Tuesday, the Minister of Transport,
Fikile Mbalula finally confirmed that the Moloto Rail Corridor project was
nothing but an election gimmick and a pipe dream. In his
response to the DA, the Minister said “the National Treasury declined a
Public-Private Partnership TA1 application by PRASA on the 3rd of December 2015
on the basis that the project was mainly unaffordable, and the unlikelihood of
the project yielding the social economic and developmental benefits as
envisaged in the feasibility study”. This
essentially confirms a long held view of the DA that the project was nothing
but a scheme to solicit votes for the past decade. For the past 12 years, the
ANC has promised the Moloto Rail Corridor in what is clearly an attempt to dupe
voters and play on the emotions of the people of Siyabuswa, KwaMhlanga, Moloto
and surrounding areas in Mpumalanga. The DA will continue
to seek accountability for this project, given the fact that in the 2013/14
financial year the Department of Transport (DoT) had already spent more than
R10 million on the project and a further R7.6 million in the 2014/15 financial
year on undertaking a detailed feasibility study that was concluded in October
2014. This will constitute a R18 million in taxpayers money that has gone down
the drain for this “pie in the sky” project.

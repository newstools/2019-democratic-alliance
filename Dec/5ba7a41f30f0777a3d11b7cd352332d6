In terms of Section 139 (2) (a) of the Firearm Control Act a notice to declare a firearm amnesty will only be valid if it is approved by Parliament. Police Minister Bheki Cele and the majority of the members of the portfolio committee on Police have rushed the approval of the firearm amnesty and in so doing may have exposed Parliament and SAPS to unnecessary and costly litigation. At the outset the Democratic Alliance (DA) warned that the process should be approached with caution and due diligence so as not to cause confusion. The DA has now written to Minister Cele encouraging him to terminate the current amnesty notice and restart the process. A new notice should be sent to Parliament so that all technicalities can be ironed out by SAPS and presented to Parliament for approval. Below is the timeline of the process as it has unfolded: In their haste, the Minister and the Portfolio Committee have caused unnecessary confusion which may well lead to costly legal action being brought against the Minister and Parliament. The notice to declare an amnesty must be withdrawn by the Minister so that SAPS can ensure that all technicalities are dealt with and the notice must be sent back to Parliament. The DA will not allow Parliament to become a rubber stamp for the Executive.

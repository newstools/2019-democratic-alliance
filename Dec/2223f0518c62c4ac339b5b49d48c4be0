The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the removal of the United
Democratic Movement’s Mongameli Bobani, as executive mayor of Nelson Mandela
Bay. In his
fifteen months in office Bobani has been the most destructive mayor that this
Metro has ever seen, and has single-handedly run this City into the
ground. It comes as no surprise that every other party present voted to remove
him. The
question still needs to be asked at a national level why UDM leader, Bantu
Holomisa, who has a reputation for fighting corruption, did and said nothing
against Bobani’s reign of terror in Nelson Mandela Bay. Under
Bobani’s watch: This is
in sharp contrast to the 24 months where the DA led coalition was in charge,
with a host of successes, including among others: Now that Bobani has been removed, hopefully we can return to putting the people of Nelson Mandela Bay first.

Tomorrow is the deadline for all political parties to submit their provincial and national candidates list to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), and the citizens of South Africa can expect the ANC’s candidate list to be a clear indication of the disdain the governing party has for women. The ANC will undoubtedly have selected potential candidates who have continuously shown disrespect and disdain for women and whom are yet to clear their names from allegations of sexual abuse and rape. The fact that individuals such as Zizi Kodwa and Pule Mabe may be candidates on the ANC’s national list is indicative of the fact their selection process is flawed and that the party has a complete disregard for women’s rights. The ANC’s only concern is to protect themselves and the positions of power their male candidates hold – they have no moral incentive to hold their representatives to account. Just recently, Gwede Mantashe seemingly insinuated in an interview that there are natural ways of assaulting women. It is clear that the failing ANC’s main concern is more about deploying problematic candidates, over the quality of their character and value system. As the list becomes public, further rogue elements in their flawed selection process will undoubtedly come to light. The Democratic Alliance is the only party that will prioritise the protection of women’s rights as is set out in our sexual harassment policy and our Manifesto for Change. The DA will prioritise the safety of women and vulnerable groups through an improved police system, better prosecutors and a targeted response to gender-based violence and situations of gender inequality. The DA is the only party that can bring real Change that Builds One South Africa for All, and we will always hold those who violate women’s rights accountable for their actions.

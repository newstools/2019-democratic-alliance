The Democratic Alliance (DA) has today completed the flighting of over 1.5 million election posters across South Africa. This is the largest poster operation in the history of the Party and is testament to our strength and size across the country. Our election posters are worded in all 11 official languages, in keeping with our promise to build One South Africa for All. The messages on our posters include our promises to: The DA has entered into a contract with the people of South Africa to deliver on our promises if elected to National Government in 2019, and this poster operation communicates each of these promises to the people across our country. However, the DA is concerned that consistent reports are reaching us of other political parties defacing, removing or damaging our posters. These reports are being turned over to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), who are investigating each case, and any party guilty of poster tampering may be barred from participating in the 2019 elections. No doubt other parties are daunted by our extensive poster operation and footprint. Due to constant assaults on our posters, the DA is now announcing a cash reward of R50,000.00 for information on DA poster defacement, removal or interference, when such information leads to successful prosecution of the offender. Indeed, it is a criminal offence to interfere with a party’s election poster in any way. Tips and evidence of poster interference can be sent to report@da.org.za – these may be sent anonymously and are best prosecutable when photos or videos are sent too. As the 2019 election approaches, the DA is hard at work in all corners of South Africa bringing our message of freedom, fairness, opportunity and diversity – and we have witnessed that our support is growing stronger by the day. We are the only political party that can build One South Africa for All – come elections 2019, the DA stands ready to bring the change South Africans deserve.

Lodge you objection here We are calling on all South Africans to visit the prison-not-parliament website and  object to ANC candidates that are implicated in undermining the county’s constitutional order by implicating themselves in, among other acts, corruption, gender-based violence and state capture. Now that the ANC’s lists have been finalised, it is evermore clear that the ANC will never be renewed or self-correct. Whether the ANC and South Africa are led by Jacob Zuma or Cyril Ramaphosa, the country will not head in the right direction. South Africa will only become the country we all work for when the corrupt are in prison not parliament. The ANC submitted provincial and national candidate lists to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) that are packed with leaders who have been implicated in state capture, some who have court judgments against them and some have actively undermined the constitution. This system will send your objection anonymously to President Ramaphosa. The people of South Africa have until 02 April 2019 to voice their objections to ANC candidates who serve themselves instead of the people. We must insist that those who are corrupt are prosecuted and sent to prison, where they belong, for stealing the people’s money. South Africa deserves hardworking Members of Parliament and Legislatures who are beyond reproach. We must not allow ANC candidates to be elected to steal from us again. Let us remove criminal candidates because they belong in prison not parliament. The DA has shown itself to be the only party capable of putting the people first and Building One South Africa for All.

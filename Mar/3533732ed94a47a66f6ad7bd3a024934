Today, as the Democratic Alliance (DA) observe International Women’s Day, we would like to take an opportunity to reflect on the progress made by women in South Africa and across the world. South Africa is blessed with exceptional women who have made remarkable strides over the past year. We’ve seen the appointment of Shamila Batohi as the first woman as head of the National Prosecuting Authority; coach Desiree Ellis made us all proud when she was named CAF Women’s Coach of the Year for her stellar leadership of our national women’s soccer team; and Lt Pulane Sekgapane made headlines after bravely leading her platoon in combat when they came under fire from rebels in Sudan. And yet, for all the progress made by women this past year, there are still so many challenges women across the country face on a daily basis. The failing ANC government simply needs to do more to protect the women and children of South Africa. That Zizi Kodwa and Pule Mabe, with recent allegations of rape and sexual harassment against them, could be considered fit for inclusion on the governing party’s list of candidates for Parliament prior to their matters being heard by the courts is a disgrace The ANC continues to fail in their commitment to protect and safeguard the rights of women. Women and young girls are among the most vulnerable groups in our society and deserves more than platitudes and summits. Unlike the ANC, the DA reiterates the critical interventions that the women of South Africa are entitled to, which we will implement under a DA government. On this International Women’s Day, the Democratic Alliance reaffirms, in its mission of Building One South Africa for All, its commitment to end violence against women and children. We will work tirelessly, as we have, to advocate for our right as women to live secure, dignified lives free from all forms of public and private violence.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) extends its sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the mass shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has today confirmed that 40 people have been killed and at least 20 others injured in a mosque attack in Christchurch. The DA agrees with Ardern that this extreme show of violence is nothing short of a terror attack. Reports indicate that police have arrested four people in connection with the attack. It is alleged that a social media post by an account that is believed to belong to one of the attackers, posted a link to an 87-page manifesto, filled with anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim ideologies and explanations for the attacks. The perpetration of spreading anti-Muslim ideologies is a clear call to incite violence against a pre-determined group of people and violates an individualâ€™s freedom of religion. This manifesto must be condemned worldwide. We wish to extend our support to all the families affected and hope that those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice and held accountable for their actions.

Last year, the Democratic Alliance (DA) formally wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa requesting that he place former State Security Agency (SSA) boss, Arthur Fraser – who is currently serving as National Commissioner of Correctional Services – on suspension pending the conclusion of the investigation into serious allegations leveled against him. The DA also filed an application in the Gauteng High Court to set aside the appointment of Fraser. These allegations related to Fraser’s involvement in the Principal Agent Network initiated by the SSA and his decision to withdraw the security clearance of the Inspector General of Intelligence in order to block the release of information regarding political collusion. In response to mounting evidence supporting the DA’s allegations, President Ramaphosa, like a cat in a corner, was left with no choice other than to initiate a High Level Review Panel to probe these claims. The report released yesterday by the Review Panel vindicates the DA’s claims, with shocking findings including: Whilst the report does not specifically name those implicated, looking at periods of tenure cited in the report, it is clear that: The report recommends an overarching overhaul of the intelligence and security architecture of the country. The Democratic Alliance calls for the immediate suspension from public services of all those implicated. Criminal charges must also be laid with the SAPS to finally bring to book those who have looted the SSA for the nefarious ends of ex-President Jacob Zuma, the Gupta’s and their corrupt cronies.

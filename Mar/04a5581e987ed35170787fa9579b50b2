The Democratic Alliance (DA) will submit a supplementary complaint to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) following the former Bosasa CFO, Angelo Agrizzi’s latest revelations today – suggesting that the company had set up “war rooms” for the ANC in the 2011, 2014 and 2016 elections in order to avoid prosecutions emanating from an SIU investigation – to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). The allegations made by Agrizzi today would suggest that Bosasa not only sought to influence the outcomes of the elections, but to seemingly interfere with investigations by the SIU. The DA will send this new information to supplement a previous complaint the DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, in February, regarding reports that Bosasa set up ANC election ‘war rooms’ over the past three elections. The IEC has already confirmed that it is in the process of investigating the initial complaint on the matter and these latest allegations must now be considered. We are of the view that the allegation that Bosasa set up ANC election ‘war rooms’ contravenes of Section 9(e) of the Electoral Code of Conduct, which states that: “No registered party or candidate may abuse a position of power, privilege or influence, including parental, patriarchal, traditional or employment authority to influence the conduct or outcome of an election”. In our view, this is not only an attempt to interfere in free and fair elections, but also our criminal justice system. The setup and funding of these war rooms weas not merely a donation as the ANC would like to claim, they were bribes to avoid criminal prosecution. We trust the IEC will investigate this matter without fear or favour, and that those implicated are held to account

The Democratic Alliance (DA) yesterday submitted its full lists of candidates to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for provincial legislatures and the national assembly. The DA’s lists process showcases our commitment to building One South Africa for All. Our lists are more diverse than any party’s in South Africa and include people of the highest calibre from across a diversity of backgrounds. We are proud that we have nominated such a team of talented, hard-working and honest South Africans to represent the hopes and aspirations of all South Africans. This process reaffirms our values of freedom, fairness, opportunity and diversity. The DA has put forward the country’s best representatives who will champion the need to Build One South Africa for All. Between now and election day they will campaign to ensure that there is a job in every home, corruption is stopped, our country’s borders are secure, we are kept safe by an honest and professional police service, and the delivery of basic services accelerated. Over this weekend, the DA’s Federal Executive Chairperson, James Selfe, will present the full list once all consultations have taken place with some of those who may have been confidential candidates in this process. While other political parties are re-electing the corrupt who belong in prison, we have nominated people who will put the people of South Africa first.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) sends out our heartfelt condolences to the people of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi who have been affected by the devastating Cyclone Idia. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who lost their loved ones, as well as those who have been injured and suffered losses due from the disaster. We wish the South African National Defence Force and other organisations all the best in their efforts to render assistance to our neighbours. We stand firm in the conviction that we have a moral obligation to our neighbours in this hour of need, and we are proud of the South Africans who have extended themselves to assist. The spirit of ubuntu lives on. We urge the South African government to render all possible aid that will ensure a quick return to normalcy for our neighbouring countries.

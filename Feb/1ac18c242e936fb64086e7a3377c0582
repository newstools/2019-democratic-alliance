The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Lex Mpati Commission of Inquiry into allegations of impropriety related to the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to request that they confirm whether Iqbal Surve, of Independent Newspapers, will appear before the Commission to explain the serious allegations against him that have emerged over the past two weeks. Revelations of malfeasance over the weekend implicate Surve in obtaining the R 4,3 billion “investment” in AYO from the PIC in what appears to have been false pretenses as well as the subsequent apparent misuse of these funds. This makes it essential that Surve give evidence before the PIC Commission. If necessary, he must be subpoenaed to appear. The misuse of PIC funds apparently included, amongst others, the following: The Schedule of Regulations that regulate the work of the PIC Commission include provision for the identity and evidence of witnesses to be kept secret. These provisions are contained in the following sections of the Regulations; It is highly probable that when Iqbal Surve is called to appear before the PIC Commission that he will attempt to invoke section 10 of the Regulations to enable him to give evidence in camera and in secret. Given the considerable information about Surve and AYO’s alleged malfeasance that clearly negatively impacts on government employees and pensioners, it is vital that he not only give evidence before the PIC Commission, but that the testifies in an open session. The Iqbal Surve/AYO piggy bank must be firmly shut down and urgent steps must be taken by the PIC to recover the R4.3 billion irregularly invested by the PIC in AYO before the funds have all been siphoned off to secret locations. This is particularly important given the resignations of the two AYO officials who seem to have been the only inhibiters for the looting of the full R4.3 billion of pensioners money.

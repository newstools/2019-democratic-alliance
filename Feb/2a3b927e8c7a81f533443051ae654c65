The Transport state owned entity, the Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) will celebrate its 25th anniversary with a gala dinner this evening. The total cost of the event could run into millions of rands.  This expenditure on the part of ACSA comes while the South African economy is in dire straits. The DA was informed of this lavish function last week. It’s due to take place in the expensive Sandton Convention Centre.  The DA has submitted urgent questions to the Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande, in this regard. This extravagant dinner is particularly concerning due to ACSA being one of the SOEs that have been mentioned by name in the Zondo Commission on state capture.  This is nothing more than a squandering of money that should  be better used elsewhere. The DA will also be writing to the Minister requesting him to explain how such an unnecessary expense could take place when the money could be put to better use to improve South africa’s airports. The DA will not allow wastage of taxpayer’s money to go unchallenged so that such abuse can be reduced in future.

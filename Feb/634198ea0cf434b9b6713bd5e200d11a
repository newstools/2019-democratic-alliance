The Democratic Alliance (DA) is delighted by the results of two by-elections that took place yesterday in the Western Cape. We are thankful to the voters in the City of Cape Town, Ward 54 for entrusting the DA with their vote as well as voters in Knysna, Ward 4 where we saw a massive increase in our voter percentage. The DA in the City of Cape Town, Ward 54 retained the ward with 88,63% of the vote. In Knysna, Ward 4 we saw an impressive increase of more than 20%, increasing our voter percentage from 6,42% in the 2016 municipal election to 26,97% yesterday. These by-election results together with our victory over the ANC in Bergrivier, Ward 5 last month, silence our critics and it shows that the DA is continuing to grow across the Western Cape. I am confident that Nicola Jowell will represent Ward 54 with pride and ensure that that the peopleâ€™s concerns receive top priority. I would also like to thank Thobeka Duna for helping to increase our voter percentage in Knysna, Ward 4. Yesterday in the City of Cape Town, the DA received an overwhelming endorsement from the residents of Ward 54 and in Knysna, more and more voters are turning towards the DA. Through their vote, voters have showed us that they believe in our cause and support our efforts. Now, more than ever we need change that will build our nation. We encourage all South Africans who have not yet registered to vote, to visit their nearest IEC office. It is crucial that all South African citizens of voting age are registered to vote in the National and Provincial elections on 8 May 2019. The DA values every single voter. We remain committed to keep making progress that will build One South Africa for All.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) is angered but not surprised by the revelations coming out of the Home Affairs Portfolio Committee today of the costs borne by the South African Police Service (SAPS) for the detention of undocumented foreign nationals. The lack of facilities for detained foreign nationals has occurred at the same time as the Department of Home Affairs has awarded two contracts over 15 years to African Global Operations – known as Bosasa – worth more than the R1.3 billion paid out already. Minister Siyabonga Cwele remains shockingly silent on the plans of the department to review and/or cancel the Bosasa contract. The result of the Bosasa corruption is twofold – detained foreign nationals are subjected to inhumane conditions of detention in violation of our Bill of Rights, and the SAPS is spending resources desperately needed for the protection of the public to perform the functions that Home Affairs has failed to. Tomorrow, the DA will conduct an oversight inspection of the Lindela Repatriation Centre which has been at the center of the ANC and Bosasa’s corruption. The South African people have a right to see how little their billions of rands have bought at Lindela while the Watson family lives lavishly and the Ramaphosa campaign thrived on taxpayer funds. Under a DA-led government anyone found guilty of corruption will serve a 15-year jail sentence. The DA is the only party committed to ridding the government of corruption and servicing the people.

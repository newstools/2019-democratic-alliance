As the country prepares itself for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) this evening, we cannot forget the multitude of promises he made in his first SONA, which the failing ANC government has been unable to realise. Ramaphosa’s SONA will be a sobering reminder of a State of No Action, where our people continue to be subjected to an endless loop of the same old ANC, and its cold, empty promises. The Ramaphosa-administration has become characterised by an inherent deficit of action and results. At his first SONA, Ramaphosa promised the nation a New Dawn, this Dawn is now nothing more than a pipe dream of empty promises and a president of no action, who merely works for the ANC and does not lead it. Some of Ramaphosa’s broken promises from his past SONA include: These broken promises are proof of a president who has no vision and no political will to fix the problems facing our country. Ramaphosa is simply a different driver of the same broken ANC bus. South Africans do not need workshops and summits. We need leadership and decisive action. There is urgency needed to pull millions of South Africans out of the desperation of poverty and unemployment. The sobering reality is that the State of the Nation is bleak and seems to have worsened under President Ramaphosa. South Africans will today quickly realise that Cyril Ramaphosa is unable to turn South Africa round and that the DA is the only party that can Build One South Africa for All and bring tangible change.

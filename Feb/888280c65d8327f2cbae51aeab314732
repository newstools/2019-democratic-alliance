The Democratic Alliance (DA) has today launched a petition to prevent Andile Mngxitama’s BLF from contesting the 2019 General Elections. The BLF has shown itself it to be a cabal of unrepentant racists whose mission is to divide South Africans along racial lines and to undermine the constitutional value which states the “South Africa belongs to all who live in it.” We, therefore, call upon the people of South Africa whose interest is in building One South Africa for All to lend their support to this petition. The IEC also has an important role to play in this regard; it cannot in good conscience accept that a party, which marvels at the death of three young learners at Hoërskool Driehoek, is placed on the ballot paper and given the opportunity to contest in order to peddle hate along racial lines in parliament or the country’s nine provincial legislatures. Further to this, we have reported the BLF to the SA Human Rights Commission. We will request that this matter be expedited so that we can use the SAHRC report as the basis of our case to the IEC to have the BLF barred from running in this election campaign. It is important that all South Africans stand up against the politics of division, regardless of who peddles up it, and stand together in order to build One South Africa for All. The DA will never abandon the project of reconciliation. “Unity in diversity”, should not just be words, it is a call to action that we should all take up.

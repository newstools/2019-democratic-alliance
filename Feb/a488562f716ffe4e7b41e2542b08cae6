The ANC’s Acting National Spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa’s description of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland’s call for political commitment to hold those found guilty of corruption to account, as an “Imperialist act” designed to recolonize South Africa is reckless political opportunism. This is indicative of an ANC government that has no intention of ensuring that those who have looted public money are sent to jail. Furthermore, it signifies that the ANC is unable to decisively tackle corruption. At a time when President Cyril Ramaphosa, is going around the world preaching “renewal” and telling potential investors that South Africa is open for business; it is clear that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Even worse, it means that factions of the ANC are actively sabotaging attempts to attract foreign investment if it will mean that those within their ranks are prosecuted for corruption.  This is blatant political blackmail. Instead of taking heed of the red flag being raised by potential investors, Kodwa has resorted to populist utterances that are both divisive and misleading. The fact that the ANC is undermining its own investment drive shows that President Ramaphosa is an extension of the ANC problems affecting the lack of policy certainty in the country. It is only under a DA government that a conducive environment for investors could be created. Foreign Direct Investment is crucial to our economic growth. With South Africa’s increasing unemployment rate, we cannot afford to put at risk any of the 1.5 million jobs that are contributed by these countries and other potential investors. In the next coming months, South Africans have a clear choice to make. They can vote for a party that creates a better climate for investment and fair access to jobs or an ANC government that will protect the corrupt even at the expense of much-needed job opportunities.

 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the vandalisation of the Party’s billboard, which read “The ANC has killed the lights affecting 57 million South Africans! Time for us to take their power.” While we do not know who the perpetrators are at this point, we do know that this is not the first time one of our billboards depicting the ANC’s failures have been destroyed. We will not be deterred by this blatant act of sabotage. We will fix our billboard and we will proceed to lay criminal charges today at 14:30 at the Parkview Police Station, 71 Dundalk Ave, Parkview, Randburg, 2193 in Johannesburg. The fact remains that under the failing ANC, Eskom has once again plunged South Africa into darkness. No amount of vandalism or arson will hide the fact that Eskom continues to fail in its mandate of providing services to the people of South Africa. The truth is that the failing ANC is completely incapable of fixing the challenges at the ailing power utility. The DA is the only party with a plan to fix Eskom with our “cheaper electricity bill”. The DA’s plan would amount to real change, not merely board reshuffles and empty promises. The ANC has killed the lights at Eskom and it is now up to the people to vote the ANC out of power.

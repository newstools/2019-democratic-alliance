I have written to Heather Sonn, Chair of the Steinhoff board, to request confirmation that the report on the forensic investigations undertaken by audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) will be completed by Thursday 28 February. The PWC report was due at the end of 2018 but was delayed until the end of February 2019. Millions of South Africans including pensioners and the Government Employees Pension Fund have lost much of their life savings in the Steinhoff debacle and fraud. These hard hit people and all South Africans urgently need to know the extent of the Steinhoff malfeasance. It is now over a year since the bombshell exploded and Markus Jooste resigned from Steinhoff, apparently by way of a curt SMS, and has since apparently continued to live a life of luxury in South Africa. Markus Jooste has apparently still not been charged with any offence. The Steinhoff board must ensure that the PWC report is completed urgently and made available to the relevant authorities so that criminal action can be taken against those who caused the massive losses to ordinary South Africans especially pensioners. This report must also be submitted to Parliament as soon as it becomes available.

Today, Democratic Alliance (DA) Leader, Mmusi Maimane, kicked off the Party’s manifesto mobilisation week in his hometown of Soweto, Gauteng, ahead of the party’s Manifesto Launch at the Rand Stadium in Johannesburg this Saturday, 23 February. Maimane went door-to-door, engaging with residents and encouraging them to join this coming Saturday where we will make history and unveil our agenda for change. Pictures are attached here, here, here, here and here. Our manifesto is grounded on our offer to bring immediate change that builds One South Africa for All where there’s a job in every home, our communities and streets are safe, our borders are secure, basic services are delivered to all, and corruption is crushed. The manifesto is a strong plan with implementable solutions to rescue our economy, and we believe that our offer will resonate with South Africans who want immediate change. Over the coming days, DA public representatives, MPs, MPLs, Mayors, Councillors, and activists will cover every corner of Gauteng mobilising citizens to fill the Rand Stadium this coming Saturday. The choice that lies before South Africans when they cast their votes on 8 May this year is a choice between another 5 years of talk shops, summits, corruption and empty promises from the ANC, or DA’s agenda for immediate change that builds One South Africa for All.

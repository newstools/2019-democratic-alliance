The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision by the Commissioner for Restitution of Land Rights (CRLR) to freeze Nwandlamharhi Community Property Association (CPA) bank account pending forensic investigation outcomes. Since 2014 the DA has pushed for transparency and fair treatment for the Mala Mala beneficiaries whom we felt have been misrepresented. In June 2018 the DA proposed that the Mala Mala land deal be subjected to a forensic investigation. This follows allegations by a number of Mala Mala land beneficiaries accusing Nwandlamharhi CPA of mishandling and withholding dividends owed to them.. Mala Mala is South Africa’s most expensive land deal to date and has cost taxpayers R1.1 billion. Finally, after a portfolio oversight visit to Mala Mala in November 2018, the portfolio committee, realising the dire need for intervention concluded a scathing report as to the merits of purchase of the property, the current affairs, the verification of beneficiaries and the mismanagement of funds. As per the contract, R75.3 million has been paid by Mala Mala management company to the community via the accounts of the CPA and concerned attorneys, yet approximately 500 households out of the 980 households have not benefitted. The DA awaits the outcomes of the forensic investigation and verification process and we will ensure that no stone is left unturned regarding matters of transparency that will assist the poorest of the poor to receive the benefits of the most expensive land deal in South Africa’s history.

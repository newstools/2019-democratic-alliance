The Democratic Alliance has long been ready for the General Elections, regardless of the date. We now have 8 May 2019 as the day when the people of South Africa will entrust us with bringing positive change and rejecting the failing ANC, which has taken South Africa in the wrong direction and created hopelessness and despair. On 22 September 2018, we launched our election campaign premised on ‘Change that Builds One South Africa for All’ and the core campaign group, Team One South Africa that are taking off to all corners of SA. We have further announced nine highly capable Premier Candidates. With this team,  led by Mmusi Maimane, we have already covered every corner of the country, where the people are ready to vote for the DA. In just under three months there will be an opportunity for South Africans to vote for whether they want a different driver of the same unroadworthy ANC bus, or the DA, which has a plan and vision for building One South Africa for All. The failing ANC is the single greatest risk to South Africa’s prosperity. Only the DA is capable of bringing change that will open fair access to real, long-term jobs, stop corruption, secure our borders, speed up the delivery of quality services, and create an honest and professional police service. The DA difference is evident in our track record in government. By any measure, life is better where the DA governs in 34 jurisdictions and for 15 million people across the country. The power to bring change rests in the hands of the people.
